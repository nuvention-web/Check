1 hour/break. Free time 3 hours per day. 
Are
there people who you’d love to hang out with when you’re both free, but you
don’t feel comfortable directly texting and ask? If yes, who are these people? 
Yes. With most of my friends. Usually use whatsapp instead of
calling. Maybe even call close friends. If I know friends are free, I will
call. But if they might be in office, I might msg. 
Do all
your friends hang out in one circle? If not, how many friend circles do you
hang out in? 
3 big groups (India, Kellogg, SFO). I like to broadcast plans
and ask who can come. Only small groups
if there are restrictions. Specific groups for activities – like groups for
movies. Would like to broadcast to group based on activity interest. ",Not willing to share location,Customer Interview,,

From H.W. and his friends nearby, I found group messaging is a common way to schedule meetings.
