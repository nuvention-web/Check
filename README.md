# Summary

Ketch was built to enable spontaneous interaction between students.
Users drop pins onto a map to let friends know that they're free and where they are. A short description of the event can be attached.
Once the time frame of the event is over the event disappers from the database.
A map interface was created to allow users to find who is nearby.

# Customer segment

The primary customer segment is *university students*. Because students are proximate to one another, interaction is always possible. Additionally, their free time is very incongruous, so a utility that allows them to know when one another is free is of high importance.

# Value proposition

Ketch is *simple*, *private* and *fast*.
In order for students to create an event, it needs to be a simple interaction, lest they choose not to create an event at all.
Students value their privacy, especially with location data. 
Students have busy, rapidly changing schedules, so interactions with the app need to be fast.

Ultimately, we're creating a way for friends to fill their free time with one another—a way that's more private and meaningful than Facebook or Foursquare and less inconvenient than group texting.
