Technical Style Guide
=====================

The technical style guide covers the coding convention the Cloaked-Hipster team uses in developing their software. It covers coding conventions, team norms around github behavior, testing and release procedures, and external technical resources useful for people contibuting to the project.

The sections are here; depending on the team they may warrant their own pages
# Commenting and naming convention. 

-  I recommend pointing to work that has already been done.  Your naming convention should cover the following:
- Conventions for filenames and contents.  i.e. do you put a class in each file and name it in camel case to match the class name.   Do class files go in particular directories like “view” or “model” depending on where they fit in the architecture or is it for modules like “inventory” and “receivables”.
- Commenting conventions.   I suggest at least block comments for objects; record other conventions.
- Naming conventions.  What approach do you use for naming classes, variables, and methods?
  For your development environment use google to find what’s typical (e.g. gogole PHP style guide). 

  I recommend pointing to an already cooked one; perhaps noting some things that your team decides to do differently specific examples:

  - JavaScript: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com 
  - C# Example: https://mscblogs.blob.core.windows.net/media/lhunt/Publications/CSharp%20Coding%20Standards.pdf 
  - PHP: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.sample.php 

# Git Norms 
For your team (branching, pull requests, commit messages).  What is the expectation of code that is checked into master (A time to think about testing again?)

# Test Framework and Release Procedures
Speaking of testing, are there tools that you be using (e.g. PHPunit, Jasmine, CURL).  Any proposed Testing Framework and Release Procedures.

# Link to additional technical resources
Links to existing projects or technical resources that are important.  For example if you are based on MS CRM; maybe a link to the MSDN section of Microsoft. Angular app, link to [angularjs.org](http://angularjs.org).  Basing the product on a seed project? link to it here.
